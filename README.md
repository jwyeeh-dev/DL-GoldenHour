# ⏱️️ 2023 Solution Challenge : Golden Hour ⏱️

## What is Golden Hour ?
Many types of natural disasters are now five times more common in the world than they were 50 years ago. Each year, an increasing number of people are injured or killed by natural disasters.

One of the reasons for the high number of casualties is the "lack of information for proper first aid and safety guides".

To solve this problem, we created Golden Hour, an app that provides safety guides and first aid instructions.
> ### The Meaning of Golden Hour
> The first hour after the occurrence of a traumatic injury, considered the most critical for successful emergency treatment.
